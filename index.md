## About Me

Currently, I am a researcher at WeChat AI, focusing on large language model. Before that, I obtained my Master degree from the University of Hong Kong, and Bachelor degree from Southeast University. I take great pride in my contributions as a core developer and maintainer to a number of renowned open-source projects including MMSelfSup, MMPretrain, MMEngine, MMSegmentation, and OpenCompass. Currently, my interests focus on vision-language model, large language model, representation learning and basemodel. 

**We are looking for excellent interns. If you are interested in multimodal foundation models and large language models, please contact me.**
