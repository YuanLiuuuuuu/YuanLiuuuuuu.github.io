## About Me

Currently, I am a researcher at [OpenMMLab](https://openmmlab.com/), Shanghai AI Laboratory, working closely with [Songyang Zhang](https://www.zhangsongyang.com/) and [Kai Chen](https://chenkai.site/). Furthermore, I am also privileged to work alongside [Jiacheng Chen](https://jcchen.me/) from Simon Fraser University (SFU). Before that, I obtained my Master degree from The University of Hong Kong, and Bachelor degree from Southeast University. I take great pride in my contributions as a core developer and maintainer to a number of renowned open-source projects including MMSelfSup, MMPretrain, MMEngine, MMSegmentation, and Opencompass. Currently, my interests focus on vision-language model, large language model, representation learning and basemodel.
